<h1>iNZight-Online</h1>
The iNZight project was initially designed for high school students to help 
explore data fast and easy without learning complex software. The iNZight-Online 
project goes a long way further to make it accessible to a wider range of users. 
Import your own data or explore one of many example data sets. Conduct simple 
statistical analysis and interpret the data without much experience in coding or
statistics. Change and modify the data and explore many other relationships.

Help is available within each section of iNzight online. Just look for the green 
question mark, usually located in the left corner. When pressed a help text will 
appear.
