If only one column is selected the time in dates which has passed since the first of January 1900 is shown such that -1 means the second of January 1900 and so on. The first of January is day zero. Dates before tis date would be positive. If two columns are selected the differences between dates is shown, such that the first column picked is the base line all other date columns are subtracted from it. A minus value indicates that the first day came after the second and a plus value indicates that it is the other way around.
