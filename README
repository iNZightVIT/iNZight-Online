This is the new (hopefully) improved version of iNZight-online. The structure of the project was 
simplified and the user interface was rebuild. There are three main folders. Others might be 
added but this would already make the project more complex. 

Main Folders:

	data -> All data is placed here. Data need to be placed in sub directories. Those will come 
	up as data categories in iNZight-Online. Further sub directories are possible but will not 
	change much in terms of functionality.
	
	gui-elements -> This directory contains the R-code/files which setup all user selections. 
	Those files are in the format that the file names can easily be traced back which gui element 
	they setup. For example the about selection in the main navbar (defined in gui.R) is called 
	about.panel.R, the nabar selection data->current data the coresponding file is called 
	current.data and so on. There is one sub folder containing all the html (.md) files to be 
	presented in different gui elements. All .md files have similar file name format as described 
	above.
	
	www -> This folder is a folder used for all web page related things such as .css files and 
	images. Images are in a subdirectory called images.
	
Main Files:

	README -> This file. Please update me if necessary.
	  
	global.r -> All functions and variables which are used globally are defined in this file. 
	For now all functions which have nothing to do with setting up a gui element are stored 
	here.
	  
	server.r -> all shiny servere related function calls are stored in this file.
	
	ui.r -> The setup of the main gui. Images and navbar. Everything which does not change in the ui 
	is defined here. 

  VARS -> A file where variables can be set which are used as global variables in iNZight-Online
