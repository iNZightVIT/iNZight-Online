Here is something you should read:

1. observer
2. reactive
3. renderUI
4. validate

*** observer and reactive
There are lots of examples here can help you understand them.
They are the soul in shiny framework.

*** renderUI
There is lots of examples of this.
A key principal of this you need to compare to its brother: conditionalPanel
There are so much different in logical statement between Javascript and R.
I would strongly suggest to use R syntax.
Though, conditional panel can give you extra benefit in UI because it will never
create the element once its false. 
renderUI does not. You should check this. 

Details from the link: http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/dynamic-ui.html

conditionalPanel creates a panel that shows and hides its contents depending on 
the value of a JavaScript expression

The most benefit for me to just use renderUI is that it providing you a way to write
into server.R because in many case you need to get server response to decide show/hide.


*** validate
I can give some validate example:
~/tools/basic/observer.R --- paramS <- reactive({...})
~/tools/data/transform.R --- not_number/not_character functions.
