Home is the initial landing page.

 

Click the Data tab for the data-import page

 

Then click on either the Basic tab or the Time Series tab (as appropriate) to begin using iNZight Online for graphics and analysis.  

 

You can go back to the Data page to input new data at any point.  When you do so, however, all graphs and other output will disappear.

 

We are currently only telling a limited number of people where to find it to keep the initial load small while we monitor it. There is no documentation. We anticipate that that the iNZight users we tell about iNZight online will be able to figure out how it works.
